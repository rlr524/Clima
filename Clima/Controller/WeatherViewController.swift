     - Note: Because this is part of a completion handler (handles a long running task, most commonly network
     operations such as api calls) we cannot directly update our UI from inside of it, e.g. with temperatureLabel.text = weather.tempString.
     We have to use the DispatchQueue class and handle it asynchronously because the updates to our UI are entirely
     dependent upon the api data being updated and returned.
     - Description: Remember this is a closure because we are calling it inside our performRequest function in our WeatherManager
     struct by storing it in a variable; that performRequest function is what is doing our network operation and this function
     runs at the end of that operation making it part of a completion handler...i.e. it "handles" completion of the network function. Our function
     didFailWithError is part of the completion handler too (and a closure), but we would, of course, never attempt to update our UI from inside it
     as it's only job is handle completion of our network request in the case of an error.
